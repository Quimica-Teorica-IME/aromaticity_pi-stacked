Pi-stacked systems stabilize molecular structures and enable efficient charge transport and energy dissipation in functional materials. Beyond their technological role, they provide a framework to investigate local aromaticity under spatial confinement. This work evaluates the reliability of recently developed Q_2-based aromaticity descriptors (ACS Omega 2025, 10, 14, 14157–14175) for stacked systems. Derived from the second-rank tensor Q_2 of the distributed multipole expansion (DMA), they are the first to include out-of-plane electron contributions. Pi-stacked polyfluorenes with one to four layers (F1-F4) were analyzed and compared with NICS, PDI, FLU, and HOMA. The descriptors |Q_2 |(0) and |Q_2 |_(ring atoms) accurately reproduced aromatic and antiaromatic ring trends and showed that local aromaticity remains nearly unchanged from F1 to F4, consistent with PDI, FLU, and HOMA. Conversely, |Q_2 |(±1) and NICS(±1) are affected by interlayer couplings.
